                                    Because I love them. As

                                    as I can remember, even as a little kid I loved flowers. The
                                    vivid
                                    colors, the complex textures, and the calming scents, everything
                                    about them fills me with joy. I love the look on people’s faces
                                    when
                                    they receive flowers. It’s such a sweet and simple way of making
                                    people feel loved.</p>

                                    I think starting my own
                                    flower business was obvious to most people in my life, except
                                    me.
                                    Over the years I’ve done the flowers for friends and family for
                                    birthdays, bridal showers, baby showers, bachelorettes, holiday
                                    tablescapes… you name it. I always saw them as a way to scratch
                                    my
                                    creative itch. I worked in very stressful corporate jobs for the
                                    last 10-15 years and I needed something more. I was tired of the
                                    unfulfilling grind, then our cat Nola got cancer.</p>

                                    She was only 6 years
                                    old. Nola got very sick very quickly and she eventually went
                                    blind. There wasn’t much she could enjoy, but she loved spending
                                    time outside in nature. I watched my blind cat courageously try
                                    to walk down stairs and navigate life. I watched her bump into
                                    walls and furniture like a Roomba. None of that stopped her from
                                    wanting to spend every last second doing what she loved, being
                                    outside.</p>

                                    It made me think about
                                    my own life. What was something I loved so much that I would
                                    want to spend my last free moments doing it? Playing with
                                    flowers. Growing flowers. Being surrounded by flowers. So here I
                                    am, trying to share my love of flowers and hopefully helping
                                    other people feel loved along the way.</p>

                                    I want them to feel like they matter to someone. Someone in
                                    their life was thinking about them when they ordered the
                                    flowers. Someone was thinking about their smile while waiting
                                    for the flowers to get delivered. Someone was thinking about
                                    them and hoping they helped their day get a little bit brighter.

                                    away in a week. So I enjoy things as they are, while I have
                                    them. Flowers are a good metaphor for life.

                                    you, consider turning that appreciation into kindness. Donations
                                    to No Kill animal charities help give vulnerable animals the
                                    time, care, and chance they deserve—so their stories don’t end
